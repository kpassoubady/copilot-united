# 🎭 Role Play - Copilot as a Junior Developer

## 🎯 Exercise Overview

Transform your breakout session into an interactive learning experience where students practice being **both** AI consumers and AI reviewers through structured role-play scenarios.

## 👥 Role Assignments

### 🤖 "GitHub Copilot" Student

- **Responsibilities**: Read out AI suggestions exactly as they appear
- **Behavior**: No editorial comments - just pure AI output
- **Props**: Can wear a "robot" badge or speak in a monotone voice
- **Key Skills**: Learn to recognize different types of AI suggestions

### 👨‍💻 "Senior Developer" Student  

- **Responsibilities**: Review, approve, or reject AI suggestions with reasoning
- **Behavior**: Think critically about code quality, security, and best practices
- **Props**: Can wear glasses or carry a "code review" checklist
- **Key Skills**: Develop critical thinking and code review abilities

### 👩‍💻 "Junior Developer" Student (Optional 3rd Role)

- **Responsibilities**: Ask questions and seek clarification on decisions
- **Behavior**: Curious learner who wants to understand the "why"
- **Props**: Notebook for taking learning notes
- **Key Skills**: Practice asking good technical questions

## 🎪 Scenario Categories

### 🐛 **Scenario 1: Bug Fix Theater**

**Setup**: A None reference error needs fixing

**🤖 Copilot Student says:**

```python
# Fix None reference error
if user is not None:
    return user.get_name()
return "Unknown"
```

**👨‍💻 Senior Developer responds:**
> "✅ Good start, but let's think about this more defensively. What if get_name() also returns None? Let me suggest an improvement..."

**🎬 Learning Moment**: Discussion about defensive programming and Optional/None handling patterns

---

### 🔒 **Scenario 2: Security Code Review**

**Setup**: Password validation function needed

**🤖 Copilot Student suggests:**

```python
def validate_password(password: str) -> bool:
    return len(password) >= 8
```

**👨‍💻 Senior Developer responds:**
> "❌ This is too simplistic and insecure! We need complexity requirements, and we should hash passwords, not store them in plain text."

**👩‍💻 Junior Developer asks:**
> "What makes a password secure? Should we tell users exactly what's wrong with their password?"

**🎬 Learning Moment**: Security best practices and user experience balance

---

### ⚡ **Scenario 3: Performance Optimization Drama**

**Setup**: Slow database query needs optimization

**🤖 Copilot Student offers:**

```python
# Get all users and filter in memory
all_users = user_repository.find_all()
return [user for user in all_users if user.is_active]
```

**👨‍💻 Senior Developer reacts:**
> "🚨 RED ALERT! This will load our entire user table into memory! What if we have millions of users?"

**👩‍💻 Junior Developer inquires:**
> "So when should we filter in the database vs. in memory? How do we know if something will be slow?"

**🎬 Learning Moment**: N+1 queries, database optimization, SQLAlchemy query optimization, and performance thinking

---

### 🧪 **Scenario 4: Test Writing Workshop**

**Setup**: Unit test needed for calculator function

**🤖 Copilot Student proposes:**

```python
def test_add():
    calc = Calculator()
    assert calc.add(2, 2) == 4
```

**👨‍💻 Senior Developer evaluates:**
> "✅ Basic test is good, but where are the edge cases? What about negative numbers, overflow, or null inputs?"

**👩‍💻 Junior Developer wonders:**
> "How do we know we've tested enough? Should every method have a test?"

**🎬 Learning Moment**: Test coverage, edge cases, and TDD principles

---

### 🌐 **Scenario 5: API Design Debate**

**Setup**: REST endpoint for user management

**🤖 Copilot Student creates:**

```python
@app.post("/users")
async def create_user(user_data: dict):
    # Create user logic
    return "User created successfully"
```

**👨‍💻 Senior Developer critiques:**
> "🤔 Several issues here: loose typing with dict, String return instead of proper Pydantic response model, no validation, no error handling..."

**👩‍💻 Junior Developer asks:**
> "What's wrong with using dict? And why not return a simple string message?"

**🎬 Learning Moment**: API design principles, Pydantic models for type safety, and REST conventions

---

## 🎯 **Advanced Scenarios**

### 🔄 **Scenario 6: Refactoring Dilemma**

**Setup**: Legacy code needs modernization

**🤖 Copilot Student suggests:**

```python
# Convert to modern Python style
def find_user(email: str) -> User | None:
    return next(
        (u for u in users if u.email == email),
        None
    )
```

**Discussion Points:**

- When to refactor vs. leave working code alone
- Breaking changes and backward compatibility
- Performance implications of generators and list comprehensions

---

### 🚀 **Scenario 7: Architecture Decisions**

**Setup**: Choosing between design patterns

**🤖 Copilot Student offers:**

```python
# Singleton pattern for database connection
class DatabaseManager:
    _instance = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = DatabaseManager()
        return cls._instance
```

**Debate Topics:**

- When Singleton is appropriate vs. dependency injection (FastAPI's `Depends`)
- Thread safety concerns
- Testing challenges with global state
