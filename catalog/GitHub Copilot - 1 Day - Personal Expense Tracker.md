## 🛠️ Project Context (Technology-Agnostic)

- Four parallel tracks share the same Copilot curriculum:
  - **Java Track**: Spring Boot Task Manager (H2 for dev)
  - **Python Track**: FastAPI Task Manager (SQLite for dev)
  - **.NET Track**: ASP.NET Core Task Manager (SQLite for dev)
  - **Python Data Analysis Track**: Data Analysis Pipeline (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Frontend: Thymeleaf/Jinja2/Razor templates; Bootstrap for styling (web tracks)
- Tools: GitHub Copilot (VS Code/IntelliJ/Visual Studio), REST Client (optional), Jupyter Notebook (data analysis)

Note: The course emphasizes Copilot workflows over specific framework training.
