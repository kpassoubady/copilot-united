# 🏆 Prompt Battle Coding Task

## Task: Write a prompt for an AI coding assistant to create the best possible solution for the following problem

- Write a method in C# that takes a list of integers and returns the top 3 most frequent numbers, sorted by frequency (descending). If two numbers have the same frequency, sort them by numeric value (ascending).
- Example:
  - Input: [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]
  - Output: [4, 3, 2]

## Requirements for the prompt

- Be clear and specific about the requirements.
- Include example input and output.
- Specify any constraints or edge cases to consider.
- Encourage the use of efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Mention the need for code comments and readability.
- Request unit tests to validate the solution.
- Encourage best practices in coding style and conventions.
- Ask for a brief explanation of the approach used.
- Specify the .NET version to be used (e.g., .NET 8).
- Request the use of LINQ where appropriate.
- Encourage handling of invalid inputs gracefully.
- Mention performance considerations for large lists 2M+ values.
- Ask for the solution to be modular and reusable.
- Encourage the use of meaningful variable and method names.
- Request the inclusion of edge cases in the unit tests.
- Ask for the solution to be documented with XML comments.
