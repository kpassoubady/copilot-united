# 📊 Where to Check Usage

## GitHub.com → Copilot Settings

1. Go to [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
2. Under your subscription details, you'll see a usage meter showing how many premium requests you've consumed this month

## In Your IDE (VS Code / JetBrains)

1. Open the Copilot Chat panel
2. At the bottom, you'll often see a usage indicator (e.g., "75% of premium requests used")
3. Once you hit 100%, it will show that you've reached the limit

## Notifications

- GitHub may send you an email or banner notification when you're close to the quota (like at 80% or 100%)

---

## 🔄 Reset Cycle

- Your quota resets automatically at the start of your billing cycle (monthly)
- You don't need to do anything — new premium requests become available right away

---

## 🔄 After 100% Usage

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premium requests stop** | You won't be able to send additional premium requests until your quota resets at the start of your next billing cycle                           |
| **Fallback to free tier** | Copilot may still respond, but only with the basic/free tier capabilities (shorter, less advanced completions, fewer context-aware suggestions) |
| **Reset cycle**           | Your quota automatically refreshes at the beginning of your subscription's monthly cycle                                                        |
