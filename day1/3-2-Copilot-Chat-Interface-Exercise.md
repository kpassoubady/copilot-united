## 🎯 Exercise 2: Slash Commands Deep Dive

### Objective
Master the four core slash commands: `/explain`, `/fix`, `/generate`, and `/optimize`.

### Tasks

#### Task 2.1: `/explain` Command
1. **Open** `src/main/java/com/taskmanager/app/entity/Task.java`
2. **Select the entire class** and use chat:
   ```
   /explain
   ```
3. **Select just the JPA annotations** and ask:
   ```
   /explain What do these annotations do for database mapping?
   ```
4. **Ask about a specific method**:
   ```
   /explain the relationship between Task and User entities
   ```

#### Task 2.2: `/generate` Command
1. **Generate a new service method**:
   ```
   /generate a method in TaskService to find all tasks by status and user
   ```
2. **Generate exception handling**:
   ```
   /generate a global exception handler for the task management API
   ```
3. **Generate test methods**:
   ```
   /generate unit tests for the TaskController class
   ```

#### Task 2.3: `/fix` Command
1. **Introduce a deliberate bug** in `TaskController.java`:
   ```java
   @GetMapping("/tasks/{id}")
   public ResponseEntity<Task> getTask(@PathVariable String id) {
       Task task = taskService.findById(id); // Wrong type: String instead of Long
       return ResponseEntity.ok(task);
   }
   ```
2. **Select the buggy code** and use:
   ```
   /fix this method signature and parameter type
   ```
3. **Create a compilation error** and ask Copilot to fix it:
   ```
   /fix the compilation errors in this file
   ```

#### Task 2.4: `/optimize` Command
1. **Create a suboptimal method**:
   ```java
   public List<Task> getAllTasksForUser(Long userId) {
       List<Task> allTasks = taskRepository.findAll();
       List<Task> userTasks = new ArrayList<>();
       for (Task task : allTasks) {
           if (task.getUser().getId().equals(userId)) {
               userTasks.add(task);
           }
       }
       return userTasks;
   }
   ```
2. **Select the method** and ask:
   ```
   /optimize this method for better performance
   ```
3. **Optimize query performance**:
   ```
   /optimize the database queries in TaskRepository
   ```

### 📝 Expected Results
- `/explain` provides clear explanations of selected code
- `/generate` creates relevant, compilable code
- `/fix` identifies and corrects syntax/logic errors
- `/optimize` suggests performance improvements

## 🎯 Exercise 3: Context Provision Techniques

### Objective
Learn to provide effective context using hash symbols and selections for better AI responses.

### Tasks

#### Task 3.1: File Context with `#file`
1. **Reference specific files** in your chat:
   ```
   #file:src/main/java/com/taskmanager/app/entity/Task.java How can I add validation annotations to this entity?
   ```
2. **Compare multiple files**:
   ```
   Compare the structure of #file:Task.java and #file:User.java. What relationships exist?
   ```
3. **Reference configuration files**:
   ```
   Based on #file:application.properties, what database configuration is being used?
   ```

#### Task 3.2: Selection Context with `#selection`
1. **Select a method** in `TaskService.java` and ask:
   ```
   #selection Explain this method and suggest improvements
   ```
2. **Select multiple related methods** and ask:
   ```
   #selection How do these methods work together? Any redundancy?
   ```
3. **Select configuration properties**:
   ```
   #selection What do these Spring Boot properties control?
   ```

#### Task 3.3: Terminal Context with `#terminal`
1. **Run a Maven command** in terminal:
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```
2. **If there are errors**, ask chat:
   ```
   #terminal Help me understand and fix these compilation errors
   ```
3. **Run tests** and get help with failures:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
   Then ask:
   ```
   #terminal Why are these tests failing and how can I fix them?
   ```

#### Task 3.4: Combined Context Usage
1. **Use multiple context types**:
   ```
   Based on #file:Task.java and #selection (select TaskService method), 
   generate a REST endpoint that #terminal (reference recent test output) validates properly
   ```

### 📝 Expected Results
- Chat responses become more accurate with proper context
- Copilot references the exact files and selections mentioned
- Terminal context helps debug compilation and test issues
- Combined context provides comprehensive solutions

   ```

#### Task 4.3: Conversation Continuity
1. **Start a conversation about adding authentication**:
   ```
   I want to add JWT authentication to this Spring Boot app. What files need to be modified?
   ```
2. **Continue the conversation**:
   ```
   Show me the SecurityConfig implementation for JWT
   ```
3. **Follow up with specific details**:
   ```
   How do I modify the existing controllers to work with JWT authentication?
   ```
4. **Reference previous conversation**:
   ```
   Based on the JWT configuration we discussed, generate the User login endpoint
   ```

#### Task 4.4: Project Evolution Guidance
