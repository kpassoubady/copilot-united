# GitHub Copilot: VS Code vs IntelliJ — Capability Comparison (updated 2025-09-29)

| Feature / Capability                                  | VS Code (GitHub Copilot)                                                                                                                                                                  | IntelliJ IDEA (GitHub Copilot)                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inline Code Completion / Suggestions**              | Very strong: suggestions appear as you type, multi-line completions, block‐level completions.                                                                                             | Yes, inline completions are supported. Users sometimes report less fluidity or fewer model options compared with VS Code.                                                                                   |
| **Copilot Chat (Natural Language Interface)**         | Fully supported: side-panel / chat view, inline chat, quick chat, etc.                                                                                                                     | Supported in IntelliJ (initially in beta / now available), with context-aware suggestions, code explanation, unit testing and related chat features.                                                      |
| **Multi-file / Workspace Context & File Attachments** | Very good support: can attach context from multiple files, can reference selection or whole files in prompts. Also has "Attach Context" in inline & quick chat.                           | More limited historically; IntelliJ Copilot Chat allows adding files for reference, but some workspace/context features have lagged behind VS Code in terms of UX and options.                                |
| **Model Picker / Multiple LLM Models**                | VS Code offers the ability to switch between models and providers (availability depends on Copilot version and provider integrations).                                                    | IntelliJ lagged on model switching earlier; model switching and provider options have been added in updates but may be less prominent depending on plugin/IDE version.                                      |
| **Command-mode / Slash Commands / Multi-Turn Edits**  | Strong: you can use slash commands in chat (for example: /tests, /fix), multi‑turn chat, and agent-like workflows in recent updates.                                                       | Some support in IntelliJ; chat mode supports natural language prompts, test generation and explanations, but the full set of slash-command shortcuts and advanced agent workflows have historically lagged.    |
| **Code Review Feedback (Pre-PR / Self-Review)**       | Available in VS Code and via integrations; Copilot features help with pre-PR suggestions and review feedback.                                                                               | Copilot code review functionality has been added to JetBrains IDEs in 2025, enabling pre-PR feedback and review assistance within IntelliJ.                                                               |
| **Commit Message Generation**                         | Supported: suggestions for commit messages based on diffs; can be customized with instructions.                                                                                            | Also supported in IntelliJ’s commit window with similar suggestion capabilities.                                                                                                                          |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts / UX Smoothness**                | VS Code tends to have a more mature, responsive UX for Copilot with smoother inline behavior and quicker feature rollout.                                                                  | Good integration in IntelliJ, but some users report occasional lag or missing shortcuts depending on plugin/IDE version and keymap.                                                                        |
| **Feature Stability / Release Parity**                | Features typically roll out first in VS Code.                                                                                                                                              | IntelliJ plugin sometimes receives features later; some features have been released in preview or beta before full rollout.                                                                              |
| **Licensing / Organizational Features**               | Enterprise and org-level controls are available; policy controls and settings for public code matching and data handling are part of Copilot governance features.                          | Similar enterprise features are supported via the plugin and Copilot settings; exact behavior depends on organization policy and subscription level.                                                     |
| **Refactoring / IDE-native awareness**                | Good contextual suggestions, but VS Code is generally lighter than a full IDE for deep refactoring-aware suggestions.                                                                      | Stronger in IntelliJ because of deep project-model awareness, richer refactoring APIs, and better static analysis integration, which can yield more precise suggestions for JVM projects.                   |
