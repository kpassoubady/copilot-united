| **Code Review (Pre-PR / Self-Review)**                | Supported: Review suggestions, security scanning, code quality feedback.                                                  | Supported: Integrated code review in IDE with similar capabilities.                                                                |

Slightly different shortcuts but fully customizable.                                 |
| **Feature Rollout Speed**                             | Features typically arrive first in VS Code (1-4 weeks ahead).                                                             | Features follow VS Code release. Gap has narrowed significantly.                                                                   |

| **Refactoring / IDE-native Awareness**                | Good contextual suggestions. Lighter IDE means less deep refactoring awareness.                                           | Stronger for JVM projects due to deep project model, type inference, and refactoring API integration.                              |
| **Custom Instructions**                               | Supported: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, workspace settings, user preferences.                                       | Supported: Same custom instructions file format, IDE-level settings.                                                               |

> **Note (December 2025)**: IntelliJ Copilot has achieved near feature parity with VS Code. The main differences are now UX preferences and rollout timing rather than missing features. Always check the latest plugin version for current capabilities.
