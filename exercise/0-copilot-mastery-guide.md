## 🚀 **Available AI Models & When to Use Them**

### 🧠 **Model Selection Examples**

Your organization may provide different models. Here are common examples:

- **GPT-4 Turbo/GPT-4o**: Best for complex reasoning, architecture decisions
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Excellent for code review, refactoring, documentation  
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Fast for simple code completion, basic prompts
- **Codex/GitHub Copilot**: Optimized for code generation, inline suggestions
- **GPT-4.5/GPT-5** (when available): Next-generation capabilities

**📝 How to Switch Models:**

```
# In Copilot Chat
/model gpt-4-turbo
/model claude-3-5-sonnet
/model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

*Note: Use whatever models are available in your organization's Copilot subscription.*

## 💬 **Advanced Chat Interface Techniques**

### 🎯 **Context Selection Commands**

Use these to provide precise context to Copilot:

#### **File & Code Selection**

```
# Reference specific code
#selection - Use currently selected text/code
#editor - Reference the entire active file
#file:src/main/java/com/expensetracker/app/entity/Category.java - Reference specific file

Example:
"Analyze this #selection and suggest improvements for JPA entity design"
```

#### **Terminal Integration**

```
#terminal_selection - Use selected terminal output
#terminal_last_command - Reference the last command run
#terminal - Reference entire terminal context

Example:
"Fix this compilation error: #terminal_selection"
"Explain what happened with: #terminal_last_command"
```

#### **Workspace Context**

```
#workspace - Reference entire project context
#git - Reference git history and changes
#problems - Reference current IDE problems/errors

Example:
"How can I improve the overall architecture of #workspace?"
```

### 🤖 **Agent Specialization**

Switch between specialized agents for different tasks:

```
@workspace - Project structure, architecture questions
@terminal - Command-line operations, build issues  
@git - Version control, branching, merging
@vscode - Editor configuration, extensions

Example:
"@workspace How should I organize my service layer packages?"
"@terminal Why did my Maven build fail?"
"@git Help me create a feature branch for expense categories"
```

## 📝 **Prompt Engineering for Java Spring Boot**

### 🏗️ **Entity Generation Prompts**

```
/generate Create a JPA entity for [EntityName] with:
- [specific fields and types]
- [validation requirements]  
- [relationship specifications]
- [additional constraints]

Example:
/generate Create a JPA Expense entity with:
- BigDecimal amount (required, positive, 2 decimal places)
- LocalDate expenseDate (required, not future)
- ManyToOne Category relationship (cascade persist)
- Audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt)
```

### 🔧 **Service Layer Prompts**

```
/generate Create [ServiceName] with:
- CRUD operations for [Entity]
- Business validation: [specific rules]
- Exception handling: [specific exceptions]
- Transaction boundaries: [read-only/write specifications]

Example:
/generate Create ExpenseService with:
- CRUD operations for Expense entity
- Business validation: amount > 0, date not in future
- Exception handling: EntityNotFoundException, ValidationException
- Transaction boundaries: read-only for queries, transactional for modifications
```

### 🌐 **Controller Layer Prompts**

```
/generate Create REST controller for [Entity] with:
- Standard CRUD endpoints
- HTTP status codes: [specific codes]
- Request/Response format: [JSON specifications]
- Error handling: [specific error responses]

Example:
/generate Create REST controller for Category with:
- GET /api/categories (return all with expense counts)
- POST /api/categories (create with validation)
- HTTP status codes: 200, 201, 400, 404, 409
- JSON response format: {"success": boolean, "data": object, "message": string}
```

## 📋 **Project-Specific Copilot Instructions**

### 🎨 **Create .copilot-instructions.md**

Create this file in your project root for consistent behavior:

```markdown
# Personal Expense Tracker - Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
This is a Spring Boot 3.2+ application for personal expense tracking with:
- JPA entities: Category, Expense
- H2 database for development
- Thymeleaf templates with Bootstrap
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## Code Standards
- Use Java 21 features when appropriate
- Follow Spring Boot best practices
- Implement proper validation and error handling
- Write meaningful test cases
- Use descriptive variable and method names

## Architectural Patterns
- Service layer for business logic
- Repository layer for data access
- Controller layer for web/REST endpoints
- DTO pattern for API responses
- Page Object Model for UI tests

## Preferred Libraries
- Spring Boot Starters (Web, Data JPA, Test, Validation)
- JUnit 5 for unit testing
- TestNG for integration testing
- Selenium WebDriver for UI testing
- H2 for development database

## Code Generation Preferences
- Include comprehensive JavaDoc comments
- Add validation annotations on entities
- Use @Transactional appropriately
- Include proper exception handling
- Generate both positive and negative test cases
```

### 📁 **Prompt Files for Common Tasks**

Create `prompts/` directory with reusable prompts:

#### `prompts/entity-generation.md`

```
Generate a JPA entity with the following template:
- Package: com.expensetracker.app.entity
- Proper JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue)
- Validation annotations (@NotNull, @NotBlank, etc.)
- Audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt) with @PrePersist/@PreUpdate
- Standard constructors, getters, setters
- equals() and hashCode() based on id
- toString() method for debugging
```

#### `prompts/test-generation.md`

```
Generate comprehensive tests with:
- @SpringBootTest for integration tests
- @WebMvcTest for controller tests
- @DataJpaTest for repository tests
- Test data builders for consistent objects
- Both positive and negative test scenarios
- Proper assertions and verification
- Mock setup where appropriate
```

## 🛠️ **Practical Examples for Each Session**

### **Day 1: Backend Development**

#### **Entity Creation with Context**

```
# Select existing entity structure in editor, then:
"Using #selection as a template, create a similar Expense entity with amount, date, description, and category relationship"
```

#### **Service Logic with Terminal Context**

```
# After seeing compilation errors in terminal:
"Fix these compilation errors in my service class: #terminal_selection"
```

### **Day 1: Web Development**

#### **Controller Generation**

```
# With service layer selected:
"Create a REST controller that uses #selection to provide CRUD endpoints with proper error handling"
```

#### **Template Creation**

```
# With existing template open:
"Create a similar Thymeleaf template for expense management using #editor as reference"
```

## 🎯 **Interactive Exercise: Copilot Command Practice**

### **Exercise: Create a Custom Category Validation**

**Time: 5 minutes**

1. **Open** `CategoryService.java`
2. **Select** the `saveCategory` method
3. **Use Chat**: "Add business rule validation to #selection that prevents duplicate category names ignoring case"
4. **Try different agents**:
   - `@workspace What's the best pattern for validation in this project?`
   - `@terminal How do I run tests for this specific class?`
5. **Reference terminal output**: Run tests, then ask "Explain these test results: #terminal_last_command"

**Expected Outcome**: Enhanced validation with proper error handling and understanding of different Copilot interfaces.

## 📚 **Best Practices Summary**

### ✅ **Do This**

- Use specific context selectors (`#selection`, `#file:path`)
- Provide clear, structured prompts with requirements
- Switch agents based on task type (`@workspace`, `@terminal`)
- Create project-specific instructions file
- Use terminal context for debugging

### ❌ **Avoid This**

- Vague prompts without context
- Accepting first suggestion without review
- Ignoring error messages or warnings
- Not using appropriate agents for tasks
- Over-relying on code generation without understanding
